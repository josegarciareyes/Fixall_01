Hello, my name is José Armando García and I live in Medellín, Colombia.
I have over a year of experience in customer service, working in a bilingual environment where I serve customers daily, which has helped me develop my problem-solving skills.

I am very adaptable, detail-oriented, and enjoy working in dynamic environments where I can learn and contribute. I am very excited about the opportunity to join TaskUs because I admire the company's people-first culture and commitment to growth.

I believe my attention to detail and communication skills make me a great fit for a content moderation role.

Thank you for considering my application.
